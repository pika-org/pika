Getting started
===============

The recommended way to install pika is through `spack <https://spack.readthedocs.io>`_:

.. code-block:: bash

   spack install pika

See

.. code-block:: bash

   spack info pika

for available options.

Manual installation
-------------------

If you'd like to build pika manually you will need CMake 3.22.0 or greater and a recent C++ compiler
supporting C++17:

- `GCC <https://gcc.gnu.org>`_ 9 or greater
- `clang <https://clang.llvm.org>`_ 11 or greater

Additionally, pika depends on:

- `header-only Boost <https://boost.org>`_ 1.71.0 or greater
- `hwloc <https://www-lb.open-mpi.org/projects/hwloc/>`_ 1.11.5 or greater
- `fmt <https://fmt.dev/latest/index.html>`_ 9.0.0 or greater

pika optionally depends on:

* `gperftools/tcmalloc <https://github.com/gperftools/gperftools>`_, `jemalloc
  <http://jemalloc.net/>`_, or `mimalloc <https://github.com/microsoft/mimalloc>`_. It is *highly*
  recommended to use one of these allocators as they perform significantly better than the system
  allocators. You can set the allocator through the CMake variable ``PIKA_WITH_MALLOC``. If you want
  to use the system allocator (e.g. for debugging) you can do so by setting
  ``PIKA_WITH_MALLOC=system``.
* `CUDA <https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/>`_ 11.0 or greater. CUDA support can be enabled with
  ``PIKA_WITH_CUDA=ON``. pika can also be built with nvc++ from the `NVIDIA HPC SDK
  <https://developer.nvidia.com/hpc-sdk>`_. In the latter case, set ``CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER`` to
  ``nvc++``.
* `HIP <https://rocmdocs.amd.com/en/latest/index.html>`_ 5.2.0 or greater. HIP support can be
  enabled with ``PIKA_WITH_HIP=ON``.
* `MPI <https://www.mpi-forum.org/>`_. MPI support can be enabled with ``PIKA_WITH_MPI=ON``.
* `Boost.Context <https://boost.org>`_ on macOS or exotic platforms which are not supported by the
  default user-level thread implementations in pika. This can be enabled with
  ``PIKA_WITH_BOOST_CONTEXT=ON``.
* `stdexec <https://github.com/NVIDIA/stdexec>`_. stdexec support can be enabled with
  ``PIKA_WITH_STDEXEC=ON`` (currently tested with commit `4b441f333adaeb8eb0a6c7f38d36af30fa7ab366
  <https://github.com/NVIDIA/stdexec/commit/4b441f333adaeb8eb0a6c7f38d36af30fa7ab366>`_).  The
  integration is experimental. See :ref:`pika_stdexec` for more information about the integration.

If you are using `nix <https://nixos.org>`_ you can also use the ``shell.nix`` file provided at the
root of the repository to quickly enter a development environment:

.. code-block:: bash

   nix-shell <pika-root>/shell.nix

The ``nixpkgs`` version is not pinned and may break occasionally.

Including in CMake projects
---------------------------

Once installed, pika can be used in a CMake project through the ``pika::pika`` target:

.. code-block:: cmake

   find_package(pika REQUIRED)
   add_executable(app main.cpp)
   target_link_libraries(app PRIVATE pika::pika)

Other ways of depending on pika are likely to work but are not officially supported.

.. _cmake_configuration:

Customizing the pika installation
=================================

The most important CMake options are listed in :ref:`getting_started`. Below is a more complete list
of CMake options you can use to customize the installation.

- ``PIKA_WITH_MALLOC``: This defaults to ``mimalloc`` which requires mimalloc to be installed.  Can
  be set to ``tcmalloc``, ``jemalloc``, ``mimalloc``, or ``system``. Setting it to ``system`` can be
  useful in debug builds.
- ``PIKA_WITH_CUDA``: Enable CUDA support.
- ``PIKA_WITH_HIP``: Enable HIP support.
- ``PIKA_WITH_MPI``: Enable MPI support.
- ``PIKA_WITH_STDEXEC``: Enable `stdexec <https://github.com/NVIDIA/stdexec>`_ support.
- ``PIKA_WITH_APEX``: Enable `APEX <https://uo-oaciss.github.io/apex>`_ support.
- ``PIKA_WITH_TRACY``: Enable `Tracy <https://github.com/wolfpld/tracy>`_ support.
- ``PIKA_WITH_BOOST_CONTEXT``: Use Boost.Context for user-level thread context switching.
- ``PIKA_WITH_TESTS``: Enable tests. Tests can be built with ``cmake --build . --target tests`` and
  run with ``ctest --output-on-failure``.
- ``PIKA_WITH_EXAMPLES``: Enable examples. Binaries will be placed under ``bin`` in the build
  directory.

Testing
-------

Tests and examples are disabled by default and can be enabled with ``PIKA_WITH_TESTS``,
``PIKA_WITH_TESTS_{BENCHMARKS,REGRESSIONS,UNIT}``, and ``PIKA_WITH_EXAMPLES``. The tests must be
explicitly built before running them, e.g.  with ``cmake --build . --target tests && ctest
--output-on-failure``.

.. _thread_bindings:

Controlling the number of threads and thread bindings
=====================================================

The thread pool created by the pika runtime will by default be created with a number of threads
equal to the number of cores on the system. The number of threads can explicitly be controlled by a
few command line options. The most straightforward way of changing the number of threads is with the
``--pika:threads`` command line option. It takes an explicit number of threads. Alternatively it can
also be passed the special values ``cores`` (the default, use one thread per core) or ``all`` (use
one thread per hyperthread).

Process masks
-------------

Many batch systems and e.g. MPI can set a process mask on the application to restrict on what cores
an application can run. pika will by default take this process mask into account when determining
how many threads to use for the runtime. ``hwloc-bind`` can also be used to manually set a process
mask on the application. When a process mask is set, the default behaviour is to use only one thread
per core in the process mask. Setting ``--pika:threads`` to a number higher than the number of cores
available in the mask is not allowed. Using ``--pika:threads=all`` will use all the hyperthreads in
the process mask. The process mask can explicitly be ignored with the option
``--pika:ignore-process-mask``. In that case pika behaves as if no process mask is set. In addition
to setting the mask with batch systems or ``hwloc-bind``, the mask used by the runtime can also be
overridden with ``--pika:process-mask``. The option takes an explicit hexadecimal string (beginning
with ``0x``) representing the process mask to use. ``--pika:print-bind`` can be used to verify that
the bindings used by pika are correct.

Interaction with OpenMP
-----------------------

When pika is used together with OpenMP extra care may be needed to ensure pika uses the correct
process mask. This is because with OpenMP the main thread participates in parallel regions and if
OpenMP binds threads to cores, the main thread may have a mask set to a single core before pika can
read the mask. Typically, OpenMP will bind threads to cores if the ``OMP_PROC_BIND`` or
``OMP_PLACES`` environment variables are set. Some implementations of OpenMP (e.g. LLVM) set the
binding of the main thread only at the first parallel region which means that if pika is initialized
before the first parallel region, the mask will most likely be read correctly. Other implementations
(e.g. GNU) set the binding of the main thread in global constructors which may run before pika can
read the process mask. In that case you may need to either use ``--pika:ignore-process-mask`` to use
all cores on the system or explicitly set a mask with ``--pika:process-mask``. If there is a process
mask already set in the environment that is launching the application (e.g. in a SLURM job) you can
read the mask before the application runs with hwloc:

.. code-block:: bash

   ./app --pika:process-mask=$(hwloc-bind --get --taskset)

.. _pika_stdexec:

Relation to std::execution and stdexec
======================================

When pika was first created as a fork of `HPX <https://github.com/STEllAR-GROUP/hpx>`_ in 2022
stdexec was in its infancy. Because of this, pika contains an implementation of a subset of the
earlier revisions of P2300. The main differences to stdexec and the proposed facilities are:

- The pika implementation uses C++17 and thus does not make use of concepts or coroutines. This
  allows compatibility with slightly older compiler versions and e.g. nvcc.
- The pika implementation uses ``value_types``, ``error_types``, and ``sends_done`` instead of
  ``completion_signatures`` in sender types, as in the `first 3 revisions of P2300
  <https://wg21.link/p2300r3>`_.
- ``pika::this_thread::experimental::sync_wait`` differs from ``std::this_thread::sync_wait`` in that
  the former expects the sender to send a single value which is returned directly by ``sync_wait``. If
  no value is sent by the sender, ``sync_wait`` returns `void`.  Errors in ``set_error`` are thrown and
  ``set_stopped`` is not supported.

pika has an experimental CMake option ``PIKA_WITH_STDEXEC`` which can be enabled to use stdexec for
the P2300 facilities. pika brings the ``stdexec`` namespace into ``pika::execution::experimental``,
but provides otherwise no guarantees of interchangeable functionality. pika only implements a subset
of the proposed sender algorithms which is why we recommend that you enable ``PIKA_WITH_STDEXEC``
whenever possible. We plan to deprecate and remove the P2300 implementation in pika in favour of
stdexec and/or standard library implementations.
