# Changelog

## 0.31.0 (2024-12-18)

### New features

- The `require_started` sender adaptor, `any_sender` and `unique_any_sender`, `async_rw_mutex`, and CUDA functionality have been documented. ([#1297](https://github.com/pika-org/pika/pull/1297), [#1309](https://github.com/pika-org/pika/pull/1309), [#1355](https://github.com/pika-org/pika/pull/1355), [#1356](https://github.com/pika-org/pika/pull/1356))
- The type-erased receiver used internally by `any_sender` no longer requires heap allocation. ([#1354](https://github.com/pika-org/pika/pull/1354))

### Breaking changes

- Support for ittnotify has been removed. ([#1290](https://github.com/pika-org/pika/pull/1290))
- The CUDA and HIP pools now create a fixed number of streams instead of creating streams based on the number of worker threads. **This is a silent breaking API change**. If you are creating pools with a custom number of streams make sure that the values are reasonable with the new behaviour. See the [API documentation](https://pikacpp.org/api.html#_CPPv4N4pika4cuda12experimental9cuda_poolE) for more details. ([#1294](https://github.com/pika-org/pika/pull/1294))
- The `set_value` CPO now uses member functions instead of `tag_invoke` to better align with P2300. ([#1295](https://github.com/pika-org/pika/pull/1295))
- `zip_iterator` has been removed. ([#1347](https://github.com/pika-org/pika/pull/1347))

## 0.15.1 (2023-05-12)

### Bugfixes

- Eagerly reset shared state in `async_rw_mutex`. This prevents deadlocks in certain use cases of `async_rw_mutex`. ([#677](https://github.com/pika-org/pika/pull/677))
- Use `pika::spinlock` instead of `pika::mutex` in `async_rw_mutex`. This allows use of `async_rw_mutex` from non-pika threads. ([#679](https://github.com/pika-org/pika/pull/679))

## 0.15.0 (2023-05-03)

The functionality is still experimental in the `pika::execution::experimental` namespace. `async_rw_mutex_access_type` and `async_rw_mutex_access_wrapper` have also been moved out of the `detail` namespace. ([#655](https://github.com/pika-org/pika/pull/655))

### Breaking changes

- The `any_sender` and `unique_any_sender` `operator bool()`, which can be used to check whether the sender contains a valid sender, is now `explicit` to avoid accidental conversions. ([#653](https://github.com/pika-org/pika/pull/653))
- Scheduler idling was disabled by default. This typically improves performance. If performance is less important than resource usage idling may be beneficial to enable explicitly. ([#661](https://github.com/pika-org/pika/pull/661))

- Thread guard pages were disabled by default. This often improves performance. They can still be enabled at runtime with the configuration option  `pika.stacks.use_guard_pages=1` to debug e.g. stack overflows. ([#663](https://github.com/pika-org/pika/pull/663))
- The `fast_idle` and `delay_exit` scheduler modes were completely removed as they added overhead and were not used in any meaningful way in the scheduler. ([#664](https://github.com/pika-org/pika/pull/664))
- The ability to run background threads in the scheduler was completely removed. ([#665](https://github.com/pika-org/pika/pull/665), [#668](https://github.com/pika-org/pika/pull/668))

### Bugfixes

- Fixed an inconsistent preprocessor guard that affected Apple M1 and M2 systems. ([#657](https://github.com/pika-org/pika/pull/657))
- Fixed preprocessor guards to enable deadlock detection in debug builds. The deadlock detection was never enabled previously. ([#658](https://github.com/pika-org/pika/pull/658))
- Thread deadlock detection will now correctly print potentially deadlocked threads. ([#659](https://github.com/pika-org/pika/pull/659))

- Allow compiling only device code with `hipcc` when `PIKA_WITH_HIP` is enabled instead of requiring `hipcc` to be used for host code as well. The `PIKA_WITH_HIP` option now has to be enabled explicitly like CUDA support instead of being automatically detected with `hipcc` set as the C++ compiler. ([#402](https://github.com/pika-org/pika/pull/402))

### Breaking changes

- If a process mask is set the pika runtime now uses the mask by default to restrict the number of threads. The command-line option `--pika:use-process-mask` which was previously used to enable this behaviour has been removed along with the corresponding configuration option. The process mask can be explicitly ignored with the command-line option `--pika:ignore-process-mask` or the configuration option `pika.ignore_process_mask`.
