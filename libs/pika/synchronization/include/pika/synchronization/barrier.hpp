// The implementation is based on the tree barrier from libc++ with the license below. Compared to
// the original:
//
// - Names have been de-uglified
// - Only the tree barrier has been kept (the original has an alternative non-tree implementation)
// - The heap allocation for the base implementation has been removed as it's not used here for ABI
//   stability
// - pika thread ids are used before std::thread ids are used for the tree index
// - Waiting is done with pika's yield_while, spinning until the expected result (yielding done
//   after some time)
//
// This implementation was last updated with
// - https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/dc57752031fb14166dff2174b36c28d27d742382/libcxx/include/barrier

    //     so a numbering step is added before the actual barrier algorithm,
    //     appearing as an N+1 round to the N rounds of the tree barrier.
    //  2. A great deal of attention has been paid to avoid cache line thrashing
    //     by flattening the tree structure into cache-line sized arrays, that
    //     are indexed in an efficient way.

    // A barrier is a thread coordination mechanism whose lifetime consists of
    // a sequence of barrier phases, where each phase allows at most an
    // expected number of threads to block until the expected number of threads
    // arrive at the barrier. [ Note: A barrier is useful for managing repeated
    // tasks that are handled by multiple threads. - end note ]

    // Each barrier phase consists of the following steps:
    //   - The expected count is decremented by each call to arrive or
    //     arrive_and_drop.
    //   - When the expected count reaches zero, the phase completion step is
    //     run. For the specialization with the default value of the
    //     CompletionFunction template parameter, the completion step is run
    //     as part of the call to arrive or arrive_and_drop that caused the
    //     expected count to reach zero. For other specializations, the
    //     completion step is run on one of the threads that arrived at the
    //     barrier during the phase.
    //   - When the completion step finishes, the expected count is reset to
    //     what was specified by the expected argument to the constructor,
    //     possibly adjusted by calls to arrive_and_drop, and the next phase
    //     starts.
    //
    // Each phase defines a phase synchronization point. Threads that arrive
    // at the barrier during the phase can block on the phase synchronization
    // point by calling wait, and will remain blocked until the phase
    // completion step is run.

    // The phase completion step that is executed at the end of each phase has
    // the following effects:
    //   - Invokes the completion function, equivalent to completion().
    //   - Unblocks all threads that are blocked on the phase synchronization
    //     point.
    // The end of the completion step strongly happens before the returns from
    // all calls that were unblocked by the completion step. For
    // specializations that do not have the default value of the
    // CompletionFunction template parameter, the behavior is undefined if any
    // of the barrier object's member functions other than wait are called
    // while the completion step is in progress.
    //
    // Concurrent invocations of the member functions of barrier, other than
    // its destructor, do not introduce data races. The member functions
    // arrive and arrive_and_drop execute atomically.
    //
    // CompletionFunction shall meet the Cpp17MoveConstructible (Table 28) and
    // Cpp17Destructible (Table 32) requirements.
    // std::is_nothrow_invocable_v<CompletionFunction&> shall be true.
    //
    // The default value of the CompletionFunction template parameter is an
    // unspecified type, such that, in addition to satisfying the requirements
    // of CompletionFunction, it meets the Cpp17DefaultConstructible
    // requirements (Table 27) and completion() has no effects.
    //
    // barrier::arrival_token is an unspecified type, such that it meets the
    // Cpp17MoveConstructible (Table 28), Cpp17MoveAssignable (Table 30), and
    // Cpp17Destructible (Table 32) requirements.
